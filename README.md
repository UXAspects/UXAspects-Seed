# UX Aspects Seed

> **Note:** The seed project is no longer the recommended way to start a new application using UX Aspects.

This is a starter project, suitable for building a new web application using [UX Aspects](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects). Since it is built with Angular CLI, it is easy to extend with new pages and components. It is configured as a hybrid application, allowing use of both Angular and AngularJS components.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/UXAspects/UXAspects-Seed.git
```

2. Install the dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project and start the development server. This will automatically rebuild when source changes are made.
```bash
ng serve
```

4. The site will be hosted at [http://localhost:4200/](https://localhost:4200/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.

You can find all possible generation options in the table below:

Scaffold  | Usage
---       | ---
[Component](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-component) | `ng g component my-new-component`
[Directive](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-directive) | `ng g directive my-new-directive`
[Pipe](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-pipe)           | `ng g pipe my-new-pipe`
[Service](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-service)     | `ng g service my-new-service`
[Class](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-class)         | `ng g class my-new-class`
[Guard](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-guard)         | `ng g guard my-new-guard`
[Interface](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-interface) | `ng g interface my-new-interface`
[Enum](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-enum)           | `ng g enum my-new-enum`
[Module](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-module)       | `ng g module my-module`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
