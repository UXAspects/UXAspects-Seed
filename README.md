# UX Aspects Seed

The easiest way to begin using [UX Aspects](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects) is to use the Angular CLI tool. This repository contains an application created using the Angular CLI along with all UX Aspects packages imported and configured and has the basic application structure and navigation in place. It also is a hybrid application allowing AngularJS components and services to be easily used within it.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/UXAspects/UXAspects-Seed.git
```

2. Install the dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the project and start the development server. This will automatically rebuild when source changes are made.
```bash
ng serve
```

4. The site will be hosted at [http://localhost:4200/](https://localhost:4200/).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.

You can find all possible generation options in the table below:

Scaffold  | Usage
---       | ---
[Component](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-component) | `ng g component my-new-component`
[Directive](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-directive) | `ng g directive my-new-directive`
[Pipe](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-pipe)           | `ng g pipe my-new-pipe`
[Service](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-service)     | `ng g service my-new-service`
[Class](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-class)         | `ng g class my-new-class`
[Guard](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-guard)         | `ng g guard my-new-guard`
[Interface](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-interface) | `ng g interface my-new-interface`
[Enum](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-enum)           | `ng g enum my-new-enum`
[Module](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate-module)       | `ng g module my-module`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
