# UX Aspects Seed

The easiest way to begin using [UX Aspects](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects) is to use the Angular CLI tool. This repository contains an application created using the Angular CLI along with all UX Aspects packages imported and configured and has the basic application structure and navigation in place. It also is a hybrid application allowing AngularJS components and services to be easily used within it.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `ng serve` to start the development server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
